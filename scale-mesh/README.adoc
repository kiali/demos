# Scale Mesh

The scale mesh demo can be used for performance and scalability testing, as well as for exercising Kiali's graph feature.

To install/uninstall a mesh, use the script `scale-mesh.sh`. You pass command line options to the script to control the size and type of the mesh. To see all the different options available, run that script with the `--help` option. The important option to know is the `--mesh-type` option whose value determines what kind of topology the mesh should have (the option value must be one of: `breadth`, `breadth-sink`, `circle`, `circle-callback`, `depth`, `depth-sink`, `hourglass`).

_(Acknowledgement: Much of this code was taken from https://github.com/kiali/kiali-test-mesh)_

## Install

To deploy the demo, use the `install` command, with optional settings passed on the command line:

For example:

```bash
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/scale-mesh/scale-mesh.sh) install --mesh-type=depth --versions=3 
```

## Uninstall

Pass the same arguments as before, only execute the `uninstall` command:

For example:

```bash
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/scale-mesh/scale-mesh.sh) uninstall --mesh-type=depth --versions=3 
```

## Build

This demo's link:https://quay.io/repository/kiali/scale-mesh-demo?tab=tags[docker image] is available on quay.io, but if you would like to build the docker image locally, you can do so by cloning this repository and running the `build` make target.

```bash
make build
```
